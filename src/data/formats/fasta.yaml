# FASTA Format
extension: fasta
name: FASTA Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Transcriptomics
  - Proteomics

description: A text-based format for representing nucleotide or peptide sequences. Each sequence is preceded by a single-line description that starts with a '>' character.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - sequences.fasta
  - genome.fa
  - proteins.faa

example_file_content: ">seq1 description\nACGTACGTACGT\n>seq2 description\nTGCATGCATGCA"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Line 1: Header of the first sequence, starting with '>' followed by the identifier 'seq1' and an optional description."
  - "Line 2: Nucleotide sequence of the first entry (ACGTACGTACGT)."
  - "Line 3: Header of the second sequence with identifier 'seq2' and description."
  - "Line 4: Nucleotide sequence of the second entry (TGCATGCATGCA)."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: FASTA → BLAST → alignment results
    explanation: A sequence from a FASTA file is used as a query in a BLAST search to find similar sequences in a database, producing alignment results.

  - pipeline: FASTA → Clustal Omega → multiple alignment
    explanation: Multiple sequences from a FASTA file are aligned using Clustal Omega to identify conserved regions and evolutionary relationships.

  - pipeline: FASTA → MUSCLE → phylogenetic tree
    explanation: Sequences are aligned with MUSCLE, and this alignment is then used as input for phylogenetic software to construct an evolutionary tree.

tools:
  - BLAST
  - Clustal Omega
  - MUSCLE
  - MAFFT
  - SeqKit
