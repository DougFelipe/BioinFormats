# Gene Transfer Format
extension: gtf
name: Gene Transfer Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Transcriptomics

description: A specialized format similar to GFF, commonly used in transcript annotation and RNA-seq analysis.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - genes.gtf

example_file_content: "chr1\tENSEMBL\texon\t11869\t12227\t.\t+\t.\tgene_id \"ENSG00000223972\"; transcript_id \"ENST00000456328\";"

example_file_explanation:
  - Represents an exon of a transcript on chromosome 1.
  - Contains metadata including gene_id and transcript_id.
  - Used to define exon-intron structures and transcript boundaries.

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: GTF → STAR → BAM
    explanation: STAR aligner uses the GTF annotation to guide alignment of reads and generate spliced alignments.

  - pipeline: GTF → featureCounts → read quantification
    explanation: Used to count the number of reads overlapping each gene or exon.

  - pipeline: GTF → StringTie → transcript assembly
    explanation: StringTie assembles full-length transcripts from aligned reads using GTF as a guide.

tools:
  - STAR
  - featureCounts
  - StringTie
  - Cufflinks

notes: GTF is more restrictive than GFF3 and widely used in expression quantification tools.
