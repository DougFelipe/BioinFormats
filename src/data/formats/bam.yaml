# Binary Alignment Map Format
extension: bam
name: Binary Alignment Map

area:
  - Genomics
  - Transcriptomics

description: The compressed binary version of the SAM format for efficient storage of alignments.

encoding_type: Binary

example_filenames:
  - alignment.bam
  - sorted_reads.bam

example_file_content: "[Binary file - not human-readable]"

example_file_explanation:
  - This is a binary file, which is a compressed version of a SAM file.
  - It contains the same alignment data but is not human-readable.
  - Requires tools like SAMtools to be viewed or converted.
  - An index file (.bai) allows for fast access to specific genomic regions.

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: SAM → SAMtools → BAM
    explanation: A text-based SAM alignment file is converted and compressed into the efficient binary BAM format using SAMtools.

  - pipeline: BAM → GATK → variant calling → VCF
    explanation: A sorted and indexed BAM file is used by the GATK toolkit to identify genetic variants, with results stored in a VCF file.

  - pipeline: BAM → IGV → genome visualization
    explanation: BAM files are loaded into genome browsers like IGV to visually inspect how individual reads align to the reference genome.

tools:
  - SAMtools
  - IGV
  - GATK
  - Picard
  - BEDTools

notes: Binary format optimized for fast processing. Requires indexing (.bai) for random access.
