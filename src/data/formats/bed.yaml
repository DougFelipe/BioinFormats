# Browser Extensible Data Format
extension: bed
name: Browser Extensible Data

area:
  - Genomics
  - Epigenomics

description: A simple format for defining genomic regions with chromosome coordinates.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - peaks.bed
  - genes.bed
  - regions.bed

example_file_content: "chr1\t1000\t2000\tfeature1\t100\t+\nchr1\t3000\t4000\tfeature2\t200\t-"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Line 1: Defines a feature named 'feature1' on chromosome 1, from base 1000 to 2000, on the positive strand."
  - "Line 2: Defines a feature named 'feature2' on chromosome 1, from base 3000 to 4000, on the negative strand."
  - "The columns are: chromosome, start, end, name, score, and strand."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: ChIP-seq peaks → BED → genome annotation
    explanation: The genomic coordinates of protein-binding sites (peaks) from a ChIP-seq experiment are stored in a BED file for downstream annotation.

  - pipeline: BED → BEDTools → genomic intervals
    explanation: BEDTools is used to perform set operations on genomic regions (e.g., finding overlaps or differences) defined in BED files.

  - pipeline: BED → UCSC Browser → visualization
    explanation: A BED file can be uploaded as a custom track to the UCSC Genome Browser to visualize specific genomic features.

tools:
  - BEDTools
  - IGV
  - UCSC Genome Browser
  - Galaxy
