example_file_explanation:
  - "Column 1: Chromosome or reference sequence name."
  - "Column 2: Source of annotation (e.g., RefSeq)."
  - "Column 3: Feature type (e.g., gene, exon, CDS)."
  - "Columns 4–5: Start and end positions of the feature."
  - "Column 6: Score (optional)."

  - "Column 8: Frame (phase)."
  - "Column 9: Attributes (key-value pairs like ID and Name)."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: GFF → genome browser → visualization
    explanation: GFF files are loaded into genome browsers to visualize annotated genomic elements.

  - pipeline: GFF → HTSeq-count → gene expression
    explanation: Used to assign sequencing reads to genomic features for RNA-seq quantification.

  - pipeline: GFF → BEDTools → feature intersection
    explanation: Used with BEDTools to find overlaps between annotated features and experimental data.

tools:
  - IGV
  - UCSC Genome Browser
  - HTSeq
  - BEDTools
