# General Feature Format
extension: gff
name: General Feature Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Transcriptomics
  - Epigenomics

description: A tab-delimited text format for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - annotations.gff
  - features.gff3

example_file_content: "chr1\tRefSeq\tgene\t11874\t14409\t.\t+\t.\tID=gene0;Name=DDX11L1"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Column 1: Chromosome or reference sequence name."
  - "Column 2: Source of annotation (e.g., RefSeq)."
  - "Column 3: Feature type (e.g., gene, exon, CDS)."
  - "Columns 4–5: Start and end positions of the feature."
  - "Column 6: Score (optional)."
  - "Column 7: Strand (+ or -)."
  - "Column 8: Frame (phase)."
  - "Column 9: Attributes (key-value pairs like ID and Name)."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: GFF → genome browser → visualization
    explanation: GFF files are loaded into genome browsers to visualize annotated genomic elements.

  - pipeline: GFF → HTSeq-count → gene expression
    explanation: Used to assign sequencing reads to genomic features for RNA-seq quantification.

  - pipeline: GFF → BEDTools → feature intersection
    explanation: Used with BEDTools to find overlaps between annotated features and experimental data.

tools:
  - IGV
  - UCSC Genome Browser
  - HTSeq
  - BEDTools
