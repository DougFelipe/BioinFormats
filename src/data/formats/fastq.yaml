# FASTQ Format
extension: fastq
name: FASTQ Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Transcriptomics

description: A text-based format for storing nucleotide sequences along with their corresponding base quality scores.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - reads.fastq
  - sample_R1.fq
  - sequences.fastq.gz

example_file_content: "@read_identifier\nACGTACGT\n+\n!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>CCCCCCC65"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Line 1: Read identifier, starting with '@' followed by a unique sequence name."
  - "Line 2: Nucleotide sequence (ACGTACGT)."
  - "Line 3: Optional separator '+' (can repeat the identifier)."
  - "Line 4: ASCII quality string where each character represents the quality of the corresponding base."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: FASTQ → FastQC → Trimmomatic → BWA → BAM
    explanation: Raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) are quality-checked (FastQC), trimmed (Trimmomatic), aligned to a reference (BWA), and compressed into a BAM file.

  - pipeline: FASTQ → STAR → gene counts → DESeq2
    explanation: An RNA-seq pipeline where reads are aligned (STAR), expression is quantified (gene counts), and differential expression is analyzed (DESeq2).

  - pipeline: FASTQ → Bowtie2 → SAM → variant calling
    explanation: Reads are aligned to a genome (Bowtie2), the alignment is stored (SAM), and this is used as the basis for identifying genetic variants.

tools:
  - FastQC
  - Trimmomatic
  - BWA
  - Bowtie2
  - STAR

notes: The standard for next-generation sequencing data. Quality scores are ASCII-encoded (Phred+33 or Phred+64).
