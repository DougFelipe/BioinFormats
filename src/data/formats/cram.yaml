extension: cram
name: CRAM Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Big Data & Repositories

description: A compressed binary format for storing aligned sequence data. CRAM reduces file size by storing differences relative to a reference genome.

encoding_type: Binary

example_filenames:
  - sample.cram

example_file_content: "[Binary file - reference-based compression]"

example_file_explanation:
  - CRAM files are binary and compressed using the reference genome.
  - They contain the same alignment data as SAM/BAM but require the reference to decode.
  - Reference-based compression enables smaller file sizes compared to BAM.

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: BAM → SAMtools → CRAM
    explanation: A BAM file is converted into a CRAM file using SAMtools with a reference genome provided.

  - pipeline: CRAM → CRAMtools → read decompression
    explanation: CRAMtools or SAMtools is used to extract alignments for specific regions or convert back to SAM.

  - pipeline: CRAM → GATK → variant calling
    explanation: Compressed CRAM files are used as input to GATK pipelines for calling genetic variants efficiently.

tools:
  - SAMtools
  - htslib
  - GATK
  - CRAMtools

  - ENA
  - EGA

notes: Efficient for large-scale sequencing datasets; smaller size but requires reference genome.
