# Variant Call Format
extension: vcf
name: Variant Call Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Clinical Bioinformatics

description: A standard format for storing genetic variations such as SNPs, indels, and structural variants.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - variants.vcf
  - mutations.vcf.gz

example_file_content: "##fileformat=VCFv4.2\n#CHROM\tPOS\tID\tREF\tALT\tQUAL\tFILTER\tINFO\nchr1\t123456\t.\tA\tG\t60\tPASS\tDP=30"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Line 1: Meta-information specifying the VCF format version (v4.2)."
  - "Line 2: Header line defining the columns."
  - "Line 3: A variant record showing a change from 'A' to 'G' on chromosome 1 at position 123456."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: BAM → GATK → VCF → annotation
    explanation: A VCF file is generated from alignments (BAM) using GATK, and then annotated to add functional information to the variants.

  - pipeline: VCF → VCFtools → population analysis
    explanation: A VCF file containing variants from multiple individuals is analyzed with VCFtools to calculate population genetics statistics.

  - pipeline: VCF → PLINK → GWAS analysis
    explanation: VCF data is converted and used in PLINK for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to find links between variants and traits.

tools:
  - GATK
  - VCFtools
  - bcftools
  - PLINK
  - SnpEff
