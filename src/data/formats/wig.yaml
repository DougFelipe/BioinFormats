# Wiggle Format
extension: wig
name: Wiggle Format

area:
  - Genomics
  - Epigenomics

description: A format designed for display of continuous-valued data such as read depth or signal intensity across a genome.

encoding_type: ASCII / UTF-8

example_filenames:
  - signal_track.wig

example_file_content: "track type=wiggle_0 name=\"Signal\"\nfixedStep chrom=chr1 start=1 step=1\n10\n12\n15\n13"

example_file_explanation:
  - "Line 1: Track definition for genome browsers."
  - "Line 2: fixedStep mode starting at position 1 with step size 1."
  - "Lines 3–6: Signal values at consecutive positions (1-based coordinates)."

pipeline_examples:
  - pipeline: ChIP-seq → MACS2 → WIG
    explanation: MACS2 outputs signal enrichment in WIG format for peak visualization.

  - pipeline: BAM → bedtools genomecov → WIG
    explanation: Read depth is calculated from BAM alignments and output as WIG file.

  - pipeline: WIG → UCSC Genome Browser → visualization
    explanation: Used to view continuous signal tracks across the genome in UCSC browser.

tools:
  - MACS2
  - BEDTools
  - UCSC Tools
  - IGV
