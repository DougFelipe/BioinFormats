        "question": "What is the primary goal of the BioinFormats platform?",
        "answer": "BioinFormats serves as a reference guide for file formats used in bioinformatics. It is designed for users of all levels—from students just starting out to experienced researchers—to quickly find and understand the structure, pipelines, and associated tools for a wide range of bioinformatics data files."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who is this platform for?",
        "answer": "The platform is designed for anyone working with bioinformatics data. This includes undergraduate and graduate students, academic researchers, data scientists, and industry professionals who need a quick and reliable reference for file formats."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this platform free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, BioinFormats is completely free to use. It is an open-source project developed with the aim of supporting the scientific community."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the search functionality work?",
        "answer": "You can enter almost any term related to a format, including its file extension (e.g., '.sam'), full name ('Sequence Alignment Map'), associated tools ('SAMtools'), a related area ('Genomics'), or even its encoding type ('Binary'). The system will search across all metadata fields to find the most relevant results."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes BioinFormats different from other resources?",
        "answer": "Our focus is on centralization and comprehensive search. Instead of browsing multiple wikis or documentation pages, you get a standardized overview in one place. Our hybrid data aggregation model, combining automated scraping with AI-driven curation, allows us to cover a broad range of formats."

    "category": "Technical Details & Data",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How can I be sure the information is accurate?",
        "answer": "Our data pipeline starts by scraping official sources like standards documentation and established biological databases. This raw information is then processed, verified, and enriched by AI models. While we strive for 100% accuracy, the project's open-source nature allows the community to report any discrepancies via GitHub, ensuring the data is continuously refined."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often is the data updated?",
        "answer": "The data is updated periodically to reflect changes in standards and to include new formats. As an open-source project, updates can also be contributed by the community at any time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do the 'Pipeline Examples' represent?",
        "answer": "The pipeline examples are illustrative workflows that show how a specific file format fits into a larger analytical context. They are not executable scripts but rather descriptive guides to help users, especially those new to the field, understand the role a format plays in a multi-step bioinformatics analysis (e.g., how a FASTQ file is used to eventually produce a VCF file)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the 'Encoding Type' metadata mean?",
        "answer": "'Encoding' specifies how the data is stored. 'ASCII / UTF-8' means it's a plain text file that can be opened in any text editor. 'Binary' means the file is encoded in a machine-readable format that is not human-readable and requires specific software to be interpreted."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are some file examples marked as '[Binary file]?'",
        "answer": "Formats like BAM or SRA are binary, meaning their content isn't represented as readable text. Displaying their raw content would be meaningless. For these, we indicate that they are binary and must be handled with specific tools, which are listed in the 'Associated Tools' section."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are the 'Associated Tools' chosen?",
        "answer": "The tools listed are some of the most widely used and officially recognized software for handling that specific format. This list is not exhaustive but serves as a starting point for users. Many other tools may also be compatible."

    "category": "Community & Contribution",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How can I contribute to this project?",
        "answer": "This is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! You can contribute by forking the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/DougFelipe/BioinFormats, making your changes, and submitting a 'Pull Request'. We have a guide for contributors in the repository that explains the process."
      },
      {
        "question": "I found an error or have a suggestion. How can I report it?",
        "answer": "The best way to report a bug or suggest an improvement is to open an 'Issue' on our GitHub repository, which you can find at https://github.com/DougFelipe/BioinFormats/issues. This helps us track all feedback in a centralized place."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm not a developer. Can I still contribute?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Non-developers can contribute in many valuable ways, such as identifying and reporting errors in the data, suggesting new file formats to include, or improving descriptions. Simply opening an 'Issue' on GitHub is a great way to start."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens after I submit a contribution or report an issue?",
        "answer": "Once you submit a Pull Request or open an Issue, our maintainers will review it. There might be a discussion to clarify details, and once approved, the changes will be merged into the main project and deployed in a future update."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I find the contribution guidelines?",
        "answer": "Detailed contribution guidelines are available in the `README.md` file in our official GitHub repository: https://github.com/DougFelipe/BioinFormats. We highly recommend reading it before submitting your first contribution."

      {
        "question": "Will the platform ever have user accounts or personalized features?",
        "answer": "While not on our immediate roadmap, we have considered features like user accounts for saving favorite formats or creating personalized collections. The implementation of such features will depend on user demand and the evolution of the platform."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will the platform eventually support a RESTful API for querying formats?",
        "answer": "Yes, that’s part of our long-term goal. A RESTful API would allow programmatic access to the dataset, making integration with pipelines, tools, and registries much easier. We’re open to collaborations and contributions to help shape this feature."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are you planning to add educational resources, like mini-courses or walkthroughs?",
        "answer": "Yes — education and accessibility are at the core of this platform. The goal is to centralize technical documentation while making it easier to understand through complementary resources like tutorials, guides, or mini-courses. We welcome contributions in this area as well."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is localization or multilingual support planned for non-English-speaking users?",
        "answer": "Since the platform was initially built by a single developer, English was chosen as the default. However, we recognize the global nature of bioinformatics and may explore localization support in the future. For now, modern browsers offer built-in translation features that can assist users."
